# WordCounterApi
•	Create an API with a single endpoint “POST /api/wordcount”
•	Wordcount should allow the user to upload a text file. The API should then perform the word count operation and return the result to the user
Word count operation:
•	Count the number of occurrences for each word in the file. (You can use if you need an example file https://www.lipsum.com/)
•	Words are case insensitive. 
•	A word can be defined as a set of alpha numeric characters surrounded by white-space
•	The result of the count operation should be the number of occurrences of each word in the file ordered by most occurrences to least
